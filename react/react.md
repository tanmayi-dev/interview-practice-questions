{"date":"2022-01-02", "value": "10"},
{"date":"2022-01-03", "value": "11"},
{"date":"2022-02-01", "value": "1"},
{"date":"2022-02-02", "value": "1"},
{"date":"2022-02-03", "value": "10"}]

Result Format:

{"january-22": 31, "february-22": 12}

---

Explanation:

For January -
{"date":"2022-01-01", "value": "10"}
{"date":"2022-01-02", "value": "10"}
{"date":"2022-01-03", "value": "11"}

{"january-22": 31}
Here,
month = january (01 - MM written as january)
year = 22 (2022 - YYYY written as 22)
date = exclude it
value = 10+10+11 = 31 (add all values for a given month)


For February -
{"date":"2022-02-01", "value": "1"},
{"date":"2022-02-02", "value": "1"},
{"date":"2022-02-03", "value": "10"}

{"february-22": 12}
Here,
month = february (02 - MM written as january)
year = 22 (2022 - YYYY written as 22)
date = exclude it
value = 1+1+10 = 12 (add all values for a given month)
